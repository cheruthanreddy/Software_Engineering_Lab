I have hands-on experience working with various software engineering tools and technologies, including Git Bash for version control, 
StarUML for designing software architecture, and Docker for containerization. Additionally, I have worked with AWS Cloud, deploying applications on EC2 instances, 
and utilized Maven for build automation. My experience also includes setting up and managing Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). 
Through these projects, I have gained practical knowledge in software development, cloud computing, and DevOps workflows.
